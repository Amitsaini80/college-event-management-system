# college-event-management-system
college event management system  is a web-based event management platform designed for Chandigarh University’s annual fest.
The system streamlines the entire workflow of event registration, participation tracking, coordinator assignment, and administrative control.

Students can easily browse events, register using their university credentials, and track all events they’ve signed up for.
Coordinators receive structured visibility for their assigned events, and administrators gain a powerful dashboard to create, update, and manage every element of the fest — including event details, coordinators, venues, schedules, and participants.

This platform aims to modernize the fest experience with a clean UI, database-driven automation, and seamless role-based functionality, ensuring a smooth and efficient management system for CU Fest 2025.
